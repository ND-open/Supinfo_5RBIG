## To Do

* 1) Is this data set tidy? If not, change its format.
Have a look on the variable "year".

* 2) If we want to make totals by country, by sector or by year, can we just add some information to the previous data set? 

* 3) Use the help to understand how the "aggregate" function works. Alternatively, you can also use the functions "group_by" and "summarize".

* 4) Compute the previous totals.

* 5) Compute the mean of emissions by country over the years. Draw a bar chart. Interpret.

* 6) Perform some regressions, by sector or by country, depending on years. Make predictions. Draw the corresponding scatterplots. Compute the regression coefficients.

* 7) Perform a regression with the total of all emissions (i.e. for all countries and all sectors) depending on years. Make predictions.
