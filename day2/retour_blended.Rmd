## The Coal dataset usecase

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# Read in the coal dataset
coal <- read_csv("http://594442.youcanlearnit.net/coal.csv")
# glimpse(coal)

# Skip the first two lines
coal <- read_csv("http://594442.youcanlearnit.net/coal.csv", skip=2)
# glimpse (coal)

# Rename the first column as region
colnames(coal)[1] <- "region"
# summary(coal)
```

1) From long to wide

What for --> representation as time serie with year and coal_consuption as new variables

```{r}
head(coal)

# coal_tidy <- coal %>% 
#   pivot_longer(., cols = names(coal)[-1], names_to = "year", values_to = "coal_consuption")

# coal_tidy %>% ggplot ...
```


2) Conversely : wide to long (for practice only)
