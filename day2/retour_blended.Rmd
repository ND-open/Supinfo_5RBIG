## The Coal dataset usecase

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# Read in the coal dataset
# coal <- read_csv("http://594442.youcanlearnit.net/coal.csv")
# glimpse(coal)

# Skip the first two lines
coal <- read_csv("http://594442.youcanlearnit.net/coal.csv", skip=2)
# glimpse (coal)

# Rename the first column as region
colnames(coal)[1] <- "region"
# summary(coal)
coal
```

1) From long to wide

What for --> representation as time serie with year and coal_consuption as new variables

ex :
```{r}
stocks <- tibble(
  time = as.Date('2009-01-01') + 0:9,
  X = rnorm(10, 0, 1),
  Y = rnorm(10, 0, 2),
  Z = rnorm(10, 0, 4)
)
stocks
names(stocks)[-1] # donne les noms des variables exceotÃ© le 1er : Time
gather(stocks, "stock", "price", -time)
stocks %>% gather(data = ., key = "stock",value = "price", -time) # %>% spread(data = ., key = "stock", value = "price")
```


```{r}
head(coal)

coal_long <- coal %>% 
        gather(data = ., key = "year", value = "coal_consuption", -region)

# coal_long %>% 
        # ggplot(., aes(year, coal_consuption)) + # colour = region
        # geom_line()
        # geom_point()

# coal_tidy <- coal %>% 
#   pivot_longer(., cols = names(coal)[-1], names_to = "year", values_to = "coal_consuption")

# coal_tidy %>% ggplot ...
```

2) Conversely : wide to long (for practice only)


```{r}
coal_long %>% 
        spread(key = "year", value = "coal_consuption")
```

3) Unit vs separate

```{r}
# --- fake id
coal_long$region <- paste0(1:6960, "_", coal_long$region)
coal_long
```






```{r}
# separate
coal_long %>% 
        separate(data = ., col = "region", into = c("id", "region"), sep = "_") %>%
        unite(data = ., col = "id_r", id, region)
```
