## To Do

  * 1) Clean the data set and in particular these variables:
    + Height: conversion into centimeters.
    + Weight: conversion into kilograms.
    + Wage, Value and Release Clause: conversion into euros (take a look at the
  functions "mutate" and "ifelse").
    + Body Type.
    + Work Rate.
    + etc.

  * 2) Check for outliers.

  * 3) Add a variable General Position which summarize the variable Position in four
values: "DEF" (for "RCB","CB","LCB","LB","RB","RWB","LWB"), "MID" (for "RCM","LCM","LDM","CAM","CDM","RM","LAM","LM","RDM","CM","RAM"), "FWD" (for "RF","ST","LW","LF","RS","LS","RW","CF") and "GK" (for "GK"). What is the interest of doing that?
